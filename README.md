# Trainings for Computational Biology

Here we have several trainings that will make you more comfortable using command line applications, file editing, using bioinformatics tools and many more. This module includes:

1. [Command line simple tasks](https://github.com/melisound/trainings/blob/main/command_line_basics.md)
2. [Command line complex tasks](https://github.com/melisound/trainings/blob/main/command_line_advanced.md)
3. [Blast on the command line](https://github.com/melisound/trainings/blob/main/blast.md)
